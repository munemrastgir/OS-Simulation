User Inputs processes to mimic operating system procedures:  
A x y for adding a new process with priority int x and memory int y  
t to terminate process using the CPU  
d x to add a process to disk int x  
p y to add process to printer int y  
S i to see that processes are using i/o devices  
S m to see the state of memory  
S r to see what processes are using the CPU and ready queue
